# Test Repository Setup for Workflow Testing

## 1. Create a New Test Repository

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository (e.g., `workflow-test-repo`)
2. Clone it locally
3. Create the following structure:

```
workflow-test-repo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-notification-workflow.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json (optional)
```

## 2. Test Workflow File

Create `.github/workflows/test-notification-workflow.yml`:

```yaml
name: Test Notification Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering

jobs:
  test-notification:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Get full history

      - name: "Test Current PR Notification"
        run: |
          echo "üß™ Testing current PR notification logic..."
          
          # Extract PR number from merge commit message
          COMMIT_MESSAGE="${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}"
          echo "Commit message: $COMMIT_MESSAGE"
          
          PR_NUMBER=$(echo "$COMMIT_MESSAGE" | grep -oP 'Merge pull request #(\d+)' | grep -oP '\d+' || echo "")
          
          if [ ! -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
            echo "‚úÖ Found PR number: $PR_NUMBER"
            
            # Get PR body using GitHub API (read-only, safe)
            PR_BODY=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
              "https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/$PR_NUMBER" | \
              jq -r '.body // ""')
            
            echo "PR Body: $PR_BODY"
            
            # Extract Asana task ID (test pattern)
            ASANA_TASK_ID=$(echo "$PR_BODY" | grep -oP 'https://app\.asana\.com/.*/(?:task|item)/(\d+)' | grep -oP '\d+$' || echo "")
            
            if [ ! -z "$ASANA_TASK_ID" ]; then
              echo "‚úÖ Found Asana task ID: $ASANA_TASK_ID"
              echo "üöÄ Would notify: Hi team, this has been successfully deployed!"
            else
              echo "‚ÑπÔ∏è No Asana task ID found in PR body"
            fi
          else

          fi

      - name: "Test Previously Failed Commits Logic"
        run: |
          echo "üß™ Testing previously failed commits notification logic..."
          
          # Get the last successful workflow run (safe read-only operation)
          LAST_SUCCESS_SHA=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \

## 3. Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Test with Manual Trigger
1. Push the workflow file to your test repo
2. Go to Actions tab ‚Üí "Test Notification Workflow" ‚Üí "Run workflow"
3. Check the logs to see how it analyzes commits

### Scenario 2: Test with PR Merge
1. Create a test PR with Asana URL in description:
   ```
   This PR fixes a bug.
   
   Asana task: https://app.asana.com/0/123456789/987654321
   ```
2. Merge the PR
3. Check workflow logs to see PR analysis

### Scenario 3: Test Failed Workflow Detection
1. Create a workflow that intentionally fails:
   ```yaml
   - name: "Intentional Failure"
     run: exit 1
   ```
2. Let it fail, then fix it and push again
3. The next successful run should detect the previous failure

## 4. Environment Setup

You'll need these secrets in your test repo:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically provided by GitHub)
- `ASANA_TOKEN` (optional, for actual Asana testing)

## 5. Safe Testing Tips

- All API calls in the test workflow are read-only
- No actual notifications are sent (just logged)
- Use `echo` statements instead of `curl` to Asana initially
- Test incrementally - start with simple scenarios

## 6. Debugging

Add these debug steps to see what data you're working with:

```yaml
- name: "Debug/Beta Information"
  run: |
    echo "Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"
    echo "Branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}"
    echo "SHA: ${{ github.sha }}"
    echo "Event: ${{ github.event_name }}"
    echo "Commit message: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}"
```
